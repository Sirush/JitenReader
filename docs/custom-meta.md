# Custom Parsing

## Preintegrated apps
[Some apps](../README.md#automatic-parsing) require additional logic to handle properly. These apps have either custom configuration or custom code to behave as expected and interact with the extension automatically on page load.

These apps can be viewed and disabled in the settings.

## Custom hosts
If you often parse a specific web app, you can enable automatic parsing for that app.

Just fill in the hosts (one per line, or separated by `,`, `;`, or `[space]`) in the settings. These hosts are recognized by the extension and parsed as soon as you navigate to them or inside the app.

In most cases you can simply enter a domain — e.g. `satorireader.com` — and it will be expanded to match the whole site (`*://satorireader.com/*`). Note that this matches the domain exactly and won't match subdomains: to also match e.g. `web.satorireader.com`, add a wildcard (`*.satorireader.com`). If you need finer control, advanced match patterns are also supported; URL matching implements [roughly the functionality described here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns).

Please note that this works properly only for static content - apps loading their content asynchronously may not work as expected. For anything advanced, see [Custom meta](#custom-meta).

```
# Parsing an app by domain
satorireader.com

# Parsing an app with an advanced match pattern
*://*.satorireader.com/*

# Parsing a local file (e.g. a script pushing to the file)
file:///*local-japanese*.html
```

## Custom meta
App integration is done by configuring a JSON object which matches one or multiple hosts.

* [The complete schema can be viewed here](https://github.com/Sirush/JitenReader/blob/dev/src/shared/host-meta/public-api.ts)
* [All internal integrations are here](https://github.com/Sirush/JitenReader/blob/dev/src/shared/host-meta/default-hosts.ts)
  * Please be aware that the samples use configuration objects that are ignored for custom meta. This serves only as a sample!

The configuration can be added as a JSON array in the settings (*you won't see them in the list, however; they are not processed in the settings page. To disable them, remove them from your configuration*).
